# Introduction

Carbon capture technologies are increasingly recognized as essential components of strategies to mitigate climate change and achieve ambitious targets like those set forth in the Paris Agreement, aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century (IPCC, 2018; Kotowicz et al., 2025). While emission reductions are paramount, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods, which actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere, are considered necessary to address residual emissions and potentially reverse historical accumulation (IPCC, 2022; Smith et al., 2023). These methods encompass a diverse range of approaches, including technological solutions like Direct Air Capture (DAC), hybrid approaches such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), and methods leveraging natural processes like Enhanced Weathering (EW) and various Ocean-based techniques (DOE, 2024).

Given the urgency and scale of the climate challenge, requiring gigatonne-scale CO2 removal annually by mid-century (Smith et al., 2023; DOE, 2024), it is crucial to evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of these emerging technologies. This report aims to provide a comparative analysis of four prominent CDR pathways: Direct Air Capture (DAC), Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Enhanced Weathering (EW), and Ocean-based methods (including Direct Ocean Capture, Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement, and others). Based on peer-reviewed literature and technical reports provided, this analysis will focus on evaluating their respective scalability potential, cost-effectiveness, and ecological impacts to inform understanding of their potential roles in a future climate mitigation portfolio.

Brief descriptions of the technologies discussed:
*   **Direct Air Capture (DAC):** Technologies that use chemical or physical processes (e.g., liquid solvents or solid sorbents) to separate CO2 directly from ambient air, followed by storage or utilization (Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016; DOE, 2024).
*   **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS):** Processes that utilize biomass (terrestrial or marine) to generate energy, capturing the CO2 emissions produced during conversion or combustion for subsequent geological storage, potentially resulting in net-negative emissions (IPCC, 2022; DOE, 2024).
*   **Enhanced Weathering (EW):** Acceleration of natural geochemical processes where silicate or carbonate minerals react with CO2, either applied to soils or potentially in marine environments, forming stable carbonates (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; DOE, 2024).
*   **Ocean-based Methods:** A suite of techniques aiming to enhance the ocean's natural carbon uptake or directly remove CO2 from seawater, including Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), Direct Ocean Capture (DOC), Ocean Fertilization, and Seaweed Cultivation for sequestration (Gattuso et al., 2021; NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).

# Direct Air Capture (DAC)

Direct Air Capture (DAC) encompasses technologies designed to extract CO2 directly from the ambient atmosphere using chemical or physical processes, followed by compression and long-term storage (often geological) or utilization (Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016; DOE, 2024). Key approaches include liquid solvent systems (L-DAC), typically using aqueous hydroxide solutions (e.g., KOH) often coupled with high-temperature (e.g., ~900°C) calcium looping for regeneration (Keith et al., 2018; DOE, 2024), and solid sorbent systems (S-DAC) using materials like amines, zeolites, or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that bind CO2, often regenerated at lower temperatures (<100°C to ~400°C) via temperature, pressure, vacuum, or moisture swings (TSA, PSA, VTSA, MSA) (Shi et al., 2020; DOE, 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025). Emerging methods like electro-swing adsorption (ESA), electrochemical processes, and membrane separation are also under development (Kotowicz et al., 2025; DOE, 2024).

**Scalability**
DAC technology is considered highly scalable due to its modular nature and independence from specific emission sources (Hanna et al., 2021; Kotowicz et al., 2025). Unlike BECCS, it has no inherent biophysical limits related to land or biomass availability (Smith et al., 2016; Hanna et al., 2021). DAC plants can theoretically be sited anywhere, ideally near low-cost, low-carbon energy sources and suitable geological storage or utilization infrastructure to minimize transport costs (Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2022). Current deployment is limited, with 18-27 operational plants globally capturing around 11,000 tonnes of CO2 annually as of 2022-2023, though larger plants (up to 1 MtCO2/year) are under development (IEA, 2022; Ozkan et al., 2023; DOE, 2024). Achieving gigatonne-scale removal, as potentially needed for climate goals, would require massive, potentially "wartime-like" investment (e.g., 1.2–1.9% of global GDP annually) and significant scale-up from current levels (Hanna et al., 2021; Ozkan, 2025). Scalability depends on continued innovation, cost reduction, and resolving infrastructure needs (Al Yafiee et al., 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025).

**Cost-Effectiveness**
DAC is currently expensive compared to point-source capture or other mitigation options (Bhatnagar, 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025). Cost estimates vary widely:
*   Current/near-term estimates: $125–$1000 per tonne CO2 (IEA, 2022; Kotowicz et al., 2025; Ozkan, 2025). Specific plant analyses show ranges like $260/tCO2 (LT DAC) vs. $608/tCO2 (HT DAC), excluding transport/storage (Söderholm, 2024). Climeworks' initial commercial price was cited as $1200/tCO2 (Herzog, 2022, as cited in Ozkan, 2025).
*   Future projections: Costs are expected to decrease with scale and innovation, potentially to $100–$300/tCO2 by 2030 (IEA, 2022; Bhatnagar et al., 2024) or $100–$600/tCO2 by 2050 (Young et al., 2023, as cited in Ozkan, 2025). However, reaching targets below $100/tCO2 is considered unlikely without significant policy support and breakthroughs (Young et al., 2023, as cited in Ozkan, 2025; Kotowicz et al., 2025).

Key cost drivers include:
*   **Energy:** DAC is energy-intensive (discussed below). Energy costs are a major factor, heavily dependent on the source. Geothermal ($250-440/t) and NG/Renewable hybrid ($250-490/t) appear most cost-effective currently, while solar/wind with storage are more variable and potentially more expensive ($300-690/t) due to storage costs and lower capacity factors impacting DAC plant amortization (Hanna et al., 2021; Ozkan, 2025).
*   **Capital Costs (CAPEX):** High upfront investment for plant construction, particularly the air contactors (Sabatino et al., 2021; DOE, 2024).
*   **Sorbent/Solvent Costs & Lifetime:** Material degradation and replacement contribute to operating expenditures (OPEX) (DOE, 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025).
*   **Technology Choice:** Solid sorbent systems (LT DAC) may have greater long-term cost reduction potential than liquid solvent systems (HT DAC) due to lower energy needs and potential use of waste heat, though HT DAC may be cheaper initially in some assessments (Sabatino et al., 2021; Fasihi et al., 2019, as cited in Kotowicz et al., 2025; Söderholm, 2024).

Policy support (e.g., carbon pricing, tax credits like 45Q) is crucial for economic viability (Bhatnagar, 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025; Bhatnagar, 2024). CO2 utilization can provide revenue streams but market size is currently limited (~200 Mt CO2/yr globally) (Bhatnagar et al., 2024; Kotowicz et al., 2025).

**Potential Ecological Impacts**
The primary ecological concern for DAC is its significant energy demand. Estimates range from 1.3 to 8.1 GJ/tCO2 for thermal energy and 0.6 to 1.8 GJ/tCO2 (approx. 167-500 kWh/tCO2) for electricity, summing to totals often cited as 2000–3000 kWh/tCO2 equivalent (Ozkan, 2025; Kotowicz et al., 2025; DOE, 2024). The environmental footprint heavily depends on the carbon intensity of the energy source used (Qiu et al., 2022; Al Yafiee et al., 2024).
*   **Climate Impact:** DAC achieves net carbon removal if powered by low-carbon energy, but efficiency varies (e.g., 0.36-0.94 tCO2-eq net removal per tCO2 captured initially, improving with grid decarbonization) (Qiu et al., 2022). Using fossil fuels (like natural gas for heat) without CCS significantly reduces net removal and requires careful LCA (McQueen et al., 2021, as cited in Ozkan, 2025).
*   **Other Impacts (LCA):** Prospective LCA studies highlight potential trade-offs. Decarbonizing the electricity supply reduces climate impact but can increase other impacts like terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion due to the resource demands of renewable energy infrastructure. These trade-offs can be mitigated by improving DAC's own material and energy efficiency (Qiu et al., 2022). Solvent-based DAC may have lower impacts than sorbent-based DAC in several categories (climate change, human toxicity, freshwater eutrophication/ecotoxicity, metal depletion), but higher water depletion (Qiu et al., 2022). Sorbent-based systems can sometimes co-produce water, especially in humid environments (Beuttler et al., 2019, as cited in Qiu et al., 2022).
*   **Land and Water Use:** DAC generally has much lower land and water footprints compared to BECCS (Smith et al., 2016; Hanna et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2022). Water use varies by technology; liquid systems require more water than solid systems (Qiu et al., 2022). One study estimated BECCS water use as 3.03 m³/tCO2 captured (Shahbaz et al., 2024), while DAC exhibits higher water usage and demands extensive energy consumption of 11.95 GJ per 1 tonne of captured CO2 (Shahbaz et al., 2024).
*   **Material Use:** Requires solvents or sorbents, which need manufacturing and eventual disposal/recycling. Potential environmental risks associated with chemical solvents (e.g., amines) exist (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).
*   **Siting:** Location impacts performance and costs due to variations in climate (temperature, humidity affect sorbent performance), energy availability/cost, and proximity to storage/utilization sites (Qiu et al., 2022; Kotowicz et al., 2025; DOE, 2024). Potential for NOx emissions if using gas-fired heating (DOE, 2024).

Overall, DAC deployment must be coupled with electricity sector decarbonization and DAC technology improvements to avoid problem-shifting and maximize climate benefits (Qiu et al., 2022).

# Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

BECCS involves utilizing biomass (such as agricultural residues, forestry products, dedicated energy crops, or potentially marine macroalgae) to generate energy (heat, power, biofuels) while capturing the CO2 released during biomass conversion (combustion, gasification, fermentation, pyrolysis) or from the biogenic carbon cycle (DOE, 2024; Gattuso et al., 2021). The captured CO2 is then typically compressed and transported for long-term geological storage (Kakaras et al., 2018). Because the biomass initially absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, capturing and storing the CO2 released during its use can result in net-negative emissions, effectively removing CO2 from the atmosphere over the system's life cycle (IPCC, 2022; DOE, 2024). Biochar production via pyrolysis with subsequent soil application or burial is also considered a form of BiCRS (Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage) (Shahbaz et al., 2024; DOE, 2024).

**Scalability**
BECCS is considered a key negative emission technology in many climate stabilization scenarios, with technical potential estimated at 2–10 GtCO2/year globally by 2050 (Fuss et al., 2018; Kakaras et al., 2018). However, its scalability faces significant constraints:
*   **Biomass Availability:** Large-scale deployment is limited by the sustainable supply of biomass feedstock without compromising food security, biodiversity, and other land uses (Smith et al., 2016; Hanna et al., 2021; DOE, 2024). Competition for biomass resources exists with other sectors.
*   **Land Use:** Terrestrial BECCS requires significant land area for biomass cultivation, raising concerns about land-use change emissions, impacts on ecosystems, and competition with agriculture (Smith et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2018, as cited in Hanna et al., 2021).
*   **Infrastructure:** Requires infrastructure for biomass harvesting, transport, conversion facilities, CO2 capture equipment (similar to fossil CCS), CO2 transport pipelines, and geological storage sites (Kakaras et al., 2018; DOE, 2024). Co-location of biomass resources and storage potential is advantageous (Sagues et al., 2019).
*   **Marine BECCS:** Using macroalgae (seaweed) could avoid land/freshwater constraints and potentially offer higher productivity (Lenton, 2014, as cited in Gattuso et al., 2021). However, this is at a lower TRL, requires significant R&D, and faces challenges related to large-scale cultivation, harvesting, conversion, and potential marine ecosystem impacts (Gattuso et al., 2021; DOE, 2024).

Hybrid systems coupling BECCS (providing carbon-negative energy) with DAC could enhance overall carbon removal and extend the impact of limited biomass resources, potentially sequestering 1.5 GtCO2/yr in the US with co-located resources (Sagues et al., 2019).

**Cost-Effectiveness**
The cost-effectiveness of BECCS varies significantly depending on factors like feedstock type and cost, conversion technology, scale, capture efficiency, transportation distances, storage costs, and policy incentives (Kakaras et al., 2018; DOE, 2024).
*   **Capture Costs:** Similar to fossil fuel CCS, typically ranging from $30–$100/tCO2 depending on the process (e.g., pre-combustion, post-combustion, oxy-fuel) and concentration of CO2 in the stream (e.g., higher concentration from fermentation is cheaper to capture) (Kakaras et al., 2018; Bhatnagar et al., 2024; DOE, 2024).
*   **Overall System Costs:** Include biomass logistics, energy conversion plant costs, and CO2 transport/storage ($10-20/tCO2 for storage, $1-3/tCO2 per 100 km transport) (Kakaras et al., 2018; Bhatnagar et al., 2024).
*   **Net Cost/Benefit:** Depends on revenue from energy/product sales (e.g., electricity, biofuels, biochar) versus the costs. One study comparing 1 MtCO2 removal pathways estimated product sales from BECCS (energy) at $233M versus $756M for Biochar production, suggesting co-product value is critical (Shahbaz et al., 2024). Marine BECCS has been estimated at $26/tCO2 removed in one study, but this is highly uncertain (Gattuso et al., 2021).
*   **Hybrid Systems:** Coupling BECCS with DAC is estimated to increase net CO2 removal by over 100% at lower costs than standalone systems (Sagues et al., 2019).
*   **Policy Dependence:** Like other CDR methods, BECCS viability often relies on carbon pricing or subsidies to account for the value of negative emissions (Kakaras et al., 2018; DOE, 2024).

**Potential Ecological Impacts**
BECCS presents significant ecological considerations and potential trade-offs:
*   **Land Use Impacts:** Large-scale cultivation of energy crops can lead to deforestation, habitat loss, biodiversity reduction, and competition with food production (Smith et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2018, as cited in Hanna et al., 2021).
*   **Water Consumption:** Biomass cultivation and conversion processes can be water-intensive. One study estimated BECCS water use at 3.03 m³/tCO2 captured (Shahbaz et al., 2024). This contrasts with DAC, which generally has lower water needs (Qiu et al., 2022), although some studies show conflicting results (Shahbaz et al., 2024), with DAC exhibiting higher water usage and demanding extensive energy consumption of 11.95 GJ per 1 tonne of captured CO2 (Shahbaz et al., 2024).
*   **Nutrient Use & Runoff:** Large-scale biomass cultivation requires significant nutrient inputs (fertilizers), potentially leading to water pollution (eutrophication) via runoff (DOE, 2024).
*   **Biomass Sustainability:** Ensuring the sustainability of biomass sourcing is critical. Full life cycle assessments (LCAs) are needed to account for emissions from land-use change, cultivation, harvesting, transport, and processing to confirm net carbon negativity (Terlouw et al., 2021; DOE, 2024).
*   **Energy Balance:** While requiring energy inputs, BECCS systems typically produce a net energy gain (e.g., ~18 GJ/tCO2 captured in one study) (Shahbaz et al., 2024). However, there is an energy penalty associated with adding CCS to a bioenergy plant (Kakaras et al., 2018).
*   **Storage Risks:** Shares the same risks as fossil CCS, including potential CO2 leakage from geological storage sites, induced seismicity, and groundwater contamination (Kakaras et al., 2018; Bhatnagar et al., 2024).
*   **Marine BECCS Impacts:** Large-scale seaweed farming could alter marine ecosystems, compete for nutrients, and impact marine biodiversity; further research is needed (Gattuso et al., 2021; DOE, 2024).

Careful planning, sustainable sourcing practices, robust monitoring, and comprehensive LCAs are essential to mitigate the potential negative ecological impacts of BECCS deployment (Kakaras et al., 2018; DOE, 2024).

# Enhanced Weathering

Enhanced Weathering (EW) is a CDR approach that aims to accelerate the natural process of rock weathering, where minerals react with CO2 dissolved in water, ultimately sequestering carbon in the form of stable bicarbonate ions in solution or as solid carbonate minerals (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; DOE, 2024). This typically involves mining silicate minerals (like olivine or basalt) or potentially industrial alkaline wastes, grinding them to increase surface area, and spreading them over large areas of land (e.g., agricultural fields) or potentially adding them to coastal or open ocean environments (related to Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement, discussed later) (Beerling et al., 2020; DOE, 2024).

**Scalability**
The global potential for CO2 removal via EW is theoretically large, potentially on the gigatonne scale, limited primarily by the availability of suitable rock formations, the logistics of mining, grinding, and transport, and the land area available for application (Strefler et al., 2018; DOE, 2024). Enhanced weathering has the potential to sequester between 25-100 Gt CO2 over a period of 50 years (Carbon Risk, 2023). This translates to a potential removal of approximately 0.5-2 Gt of CO2 per year, placing it on par with other CDR technologies like DAC, BECCS, and biochar (Carbon Risk, 2023).
*   **Material Sourcing:** Requires access to large quantities of suitable minerals (e.g., basalt, olivine). Mining operations themselves have environmental impacts and logistical constraints. Industrial wastes (e.g., steel slag, cement kiln dust) could offer alternative alkalinity sources but availability is limited compared to natural minerals (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; DOE, 2024).
*   **Application:** Terrestrial application requires transport and spreading over vast agricultural or forested areas. Integration with existing agricultural practices (e.g., liming replacement) could facilitate deployment (Beerling et al., 2020). Ocean application faces different logistical and ecological challenges (covered under Ocean-based Methods).
*   **Reaction Rates:** Weathering rates in natural settings are slow. While grinding increases surface area, the actual rate of CO2 uptake in situ depends heavily on environmental factors like temperature, moisture, soil pH, and microbial activity, leading to uncertainty in predictability (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; DOE, 2024).
*   **Current Status:** EW is generally considered to be at a lower Technology Readiness Level (TRL) compared to DAC or established BECCS pathways, with research focusing on field trials and improving understanding of reaction kinetics and impacts (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).

Specific quantitative estimates on maximum scalability were detailed in the provided sources, acknowledging gigatonne potential (Strefler et al., 2018; Carbon Risk, 2023). China, the USA, and India have the largest opportunity to use enhanced weathering for carbon removal due to their extensive land area devoted to crops (Carbon Risk, 2023).

**Cost-Effectiveness**
Cost estimates for EW vary significantly and are subject to uncertainty, particularly regarding reaction efficiencies and monitoring requirements. Key cost components include:
*   **Mining and Grinding:** Energy-intensive processes, contributing significantly to both cost and the carbon footprint of the operation (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; Strefler et al., 2018).
*   **Transportation:** Moving large volumes of crushed rock from mines to application sites can be a major cost factor, especially over long distances (Strefler et al., 2018). The longer the distance, the less likely the economics stack up, and the more likely that the emissions associated with transportation overwhelm the carbon removed from the atmosphere (Carbon Risk, 2023).
*   **Application:** Costs associated with spreading the material on land.
*   **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV):** Quantifying the actual CO2 removed via EW in complex soil environments is challenging and potentially costly, impacting the ability to claim carbon credits (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).

Some studies suggest EW could potentially be less expensive than DAC, with estimates ranging widely, often cited in the range of $50-$200/tCO2, but highly dependent on local factors like rock availability, transport distance, energy costs, and co-benefits (Strefler et al., 2018; NASEM, 2022). The economic viability may be enhanced if co-benefits like soil fertilization reduce costs for farmers (Beerling et al., 2020). Academics estimate the global cost of enhanced weathering at around $75-250 per tonne CO2, putting it firmly in the same cost bracket as BECCS and DACCS, but slightly more expensive than biochar (Carbon Risk, 2023). On a regional basis, enhanced weathering is estimated to cost $160-190 per tonne CO2 in North America and Europe, versus $55-120 per tonne CO2 in less developed but no less large emitters such as China, India, Mexico, Indonesia, and Brazil (Carbon Risk, 2023).

**Potential Ecological Impacts**
EW deployment carries potential ecological risks and co-benefits:
*   **Mining Impacts:** Habitat destruction, water use, and pollution associated with large-scale mining operations (DOE, 2024).
*   **Application Impacts:**
    *   *Soil Chemistry:* Alters soil pH (generally increasing it), which can be beneficial for acidic soils but potentially harmful otherwise. Releases elements like silica, calcium, magnesium, and potentially trace metals (e.g., nickel, chromium from olivine) into soils and adjacent water bodies, with impacts on ecosystems and water quality needing careful assessment (Beerling et al., 2020; NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).
    *   *Dust:* Grinding and spreading fine rock particles can create dust, posing respiratory health risks and potentially impacting local air quality (NASEM, 2022).
    *   *Ecosystem Effects:* Changes in soil chemistry and trace element release could affect soil microbial communities, plant life, and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Long-term impacts are not fully understood (NASEM, 2022).
*   **Co-benefits:** Can improve soil fertility by supplying essential nutrients (Ca, Mg, Si), reduce the need for agricultural lime, potentially decrease N2O emissions, and help counteract soil acidification (Beerling et al., 2020; NASEM, 2022). The silicate rocks such as basalt act as soil enhancers when spread on agricultural land: reducing the need for fertiliser, reversing soil acidification, and cutting nitrogen oxide emitted from the land (Carbon Risk, 2023). The bicarbonate ions created by enhanced weathering eventually wash out into the ocean where they promote ocean de-acidification (Carbon Risk, 2023).
*   **MRV Challenges:** Difficulty in accurately measuring CO2 uptake and distinguishing it from natural variability complicates environmental impact assessment and carbon accounting (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).

Thorough site-specific assessments, careful mineral selection (to minimize harmful trace elements), and robust monitoring are essential to manage potential risks (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).

# Ocean-based Carbon Capture Methods

The ocean naturally absorbs a significant amount of atmospheric CO2, and ocean-based CDR methods aim to enhance this uptake or directly remove dissolved CO2 from seawater (NASEM, 2022; Williamson & Gattuso, 2022). The theoretical storage capacity of the ocean is vast (estimated >40,000 Gt CO2), but harnessing this potential faces significant technical, economic, and ecological challenges (Kakaras et al., 2018). Key approaches include:

*   **Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE):** Involves adding alkaline substances (e.g., finely ground silicate or carbonate minerals, or their processed derivatives like lime or magnesium hydroxide) to seawater to increase its pH and buffering capacity, thereby enhancing the ocean's ability to absorb atmospheric CO2 (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024). This is chemically related to enhanced weathering but applied directly to the marine environment.
*   **Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) / Electrochemical Methods:** Technologies, often electrochemical, designed to directly extract dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater, typically by manipulating pH locally (e.g., via electrolysis or electrodialysis with bipolar membranes) to shift carbonate chemistry and release CO2 gas, which is then captured (de Lannoy et al., 2018; Sharbatian et al., 2023; Al Yafiee et al., 2024). The CO2-depleted, often alkaline, seawater is returned to the ocean to absorb more atmospheric CO2.
*   **Enhancing Ocean Productivity (Ocean Fertilization):** Adding limiting nutrients (e.g., iron in High-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll regions, or potentially nitrogen/phosphorus elsewhere) to stimulate phytoplankton growth, aiming to increase CO2 uptake via photosynthesis and subsequent sinking of organic carbon to the deep ocean (the biological carbon pump) (Boyd et al., 2019; Gattuso et al., 2021).
*   **Seaweed Cultivation:** Large-scale farming of macroalgae (seaweed) to absorb CO2, followed by either sinking the biomass into the deep ocean for long-term sequestration or harvesting it for other uses, potentially including Marine BECCS (discussed under BECCS) or durable bio-products (Duarte et al., 2017; Gattuso et al., 2021; DOE, 2024).
*   **Artificial Upwelling/Downwelling:** Mechanically pumping nutrient-rich deep water to the surface to stimulate productivity (upwelling) or CO2-rich surface water to the deep ocean (downwelling) (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).
*   **Coastal Blue Carbon Management:** Restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, which naturally sequester significant amounts of carbon in biomass and sediments (Gattuso et al., 2021; NASEM, 2022).

**Scalability**
Scalability varies significantly across methods:
*   **OAE:** Potentially Gt-scale removal, limited by mineral availability, mining/processing/transport logistics, and the scale of application needed (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; NASEM, 2022). TRL is relatively low.
*   **DOC:** Scalability depends on energy availability and system efficiency. May involve numerous smaller, potentially modular units, possibly co-located with existing infrastructure like desalination plants (Al Yafiee et al., 2024; DOE, 2024). Equatic's process studied for megaton-scale feasibility (Aalto University, 2023). TRL is low to medium.
*   **Ocean Fertilization:** Highly controversial. While potentially scalable in terms of area, the efficiency of carbon sequestration is uncertain and likely low, with significant ecological risks limiting practical scalability (Boyd et al., 2019; NASEM, 2022). TRL considered mid-level due to past experiments, but viability is questioned (DOE, 2024).
*   **Seaweed Cultivation:** Limited by nutrient availability, suitable ocean space, and economic feasibility for sinking pathways (DeAngelo et al., 2023; NASEM, 2022). Potential conflicts with other marine uses. TRL for cultivation is high, but for sinking/sequestration is low (DOE, 2024).
*   **Artificial Upwelling/Downwelling:** Limited by energy requirements for pumping and uncertain sequestration efficiency/permanence (NASEM, 2022; Koweek, 2022). TRL is low.
*   **Coastal Blue Carbon:** Restoration potential is important locally but globally limited compared to Gt-scale needs (Gattuso et al., 2021; Williamson & Gattuso, 2022). TRL is high for restoration techniques.

**Cost-Effectiveness**
Costs are generally highly uncertain due to the early stage of development for most methods (NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).
*   **OAE:** Costs driven by mineral sourcing, grinding, transport, and application. Potentially lower energy costs than DAC if suitable minerals are available locally, but logistics are challenging (Renforth & Henderson, 2017; NASEM, 2022).
*   **DOC:** High projected costs due to energy consumption (electrolysis/electrodialysis), membrane/electrode durability, and potential need for extensive seawater pretreatment to prevent fouling/scaling (Sharbatian et al., 2023; Al Yafiee et al., 2024; DOE, 2024). Co-production of hydrogen could offset costs (DOE, 2024).
*   **Ocean Fertilization:** Potentially low direct costs for nutrient addition, but effectiveness and permanence are highly uncertain, making cost-effectiveness questionable. MRV costs could be substantial (NASEM, 2022).
*   **Seaweed Cultivation:** Costs depend heavily on the end use (sinking vs. products). Sinking pathways currently face economic challenges (DeAngelo et al., 2023).
*   **Coastal Blue Carbon:** Restoration costs vary widely depending on the ecosystem and location. Carbon credit value needs to account for permanence and additionality challenges (Williamson & Gattuso, 2022).

**Potential Ecological Impacts**
Ocean-based methods carry significant potential for unintended ecological consequences, which are often poorly understood, particularly at scale (NASEM, 2022; Williamson et al., 2024).
*   **OAE:** Impacts of large-scale alkalinity and pH changes on marine organisms and ecosystems (pelagic and benthic). Potential release of trace metals from minerals. Effects of suspended particles on light penetration and filter feeders (Bach et al., 2019; NASEM, 2022; DOE, 2024).
*   **DOC:** Localized changes in seawater chemistry (pH, DIC, potentially temperature) from discharge plumes. Impacts of pretreatment chemicals or processes. Entrainment/impingement of marine organisms. Long-term effects unknown (Aalto University, 2023; Sharbatian et al., 2023; DOE, 2024).
*   **Ocean Fertilization:** High risk of unintended ecosystem disruption, including changes in phytoplankton community structure, harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion in deeper waters, and potential impacts on fisheries and remote ecosystems (Boyd et al., 2019; NASEM, 2022). Production of other greenhouse gases (e.g., N2O).
*   **Seaweed Cultivation:** Impacts of large monocultures on biodiversity, nutrient competition with natural phytoplankton, shading, entanglement risks, potential for disease/pest outbreaks. Impacts of sinking large amounts of biomass on deep-sea ecosystems (Duarte et al., 2017; NASEM, 2022).
*   **Artificial Upwelling/Downwelling:** Alteration of nutrient cycles, temperature profiles, and ecosystem structure. Potential to increase CO2 outgassing or enhance productivity, effects uncertain (NASEM, 2022).
*   **Coastal Blue Carbon:** Generally considered low-risk with co-benefits for biodiversity and coastal protection, but restoration success can be variable, and permanence is challenged by sea-level rise and other disturbances (Gattuso et al., 2021; Williamson & Gattuso, 2022).

Robust MRV frameworks are critical but challenging to implement for most ocean-based methods, particularly those relying on enhancing natural biological or chemical processes in the open ocean (NASEM, 2022; Williamson et al., 2024). Governability under international law (e.g., London Convention/Protocol) is also a major consideration, especially for open ocean interventions like fertilization and large-scale OAE (GESAMP, 2019; Williamson et al., 2024).

# Comparative Analysis

Comparing DAC, BECCS, Enhanced Weathering, and Ocean-based methods reveals distinct profiles regarding their environmental and economic sustainability, scalability, costs, and ecological impacts. No single technology emerges as superior across all criteria; rather, each presents unique strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainties.
